📝 TODO: Create a Shape System
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

You need to build this file with the following features:

🎨 SHAPES (shapes.js file)
  └─ Create a base shape class (TShape)
  └─ Create subclasses for each shape type:
     • TLine (start point → end point)
     • TCircle (center point + radius)
     • TRectangle (top-left corner + width/height)
     • TOval (center + width/height)
     • TPen (collection of connected line segments)
     • TPolygon (collection of points)
  └─ Each shape needs:
     1. Properties to store its position and size
     2. A draw() method to paint itself on canvas

📦 SHAPE CONTAINER (shapeManager class)
  └─ Stores all shapes that are currently on the canvas
  └─ Manages the Z-order (which shapes appear on top)
  └─ Methods needed:
     1. addShape(newShape) - add a new shape
     2. removeShape(shape) - delete a shape
     3. moveShapeUp(shape) - bring shape forward
     4. moveShapeDown(shape) - send shape backward
     5. getSelectedShape() - find which shape is selected

🖱️ MOUSE INTERACTION
  └─ Listen for mouse events on the paint canvas:
     1. mouseDown → Start drawing a new shape
     2. mouseMove → Update the shape LIVE (rubber banding effect)
     3. mouseUp → Finish and save the shape
  └─ Use current settings (newShapeType) for stroke color, fill color, etc.

⚡ RUBBER BANDING
  └─ While dragging the mouse, the shape should update in real-time
  └─ Shape only gets "finalized" when user releases the mouse button
  └─ This also works for polygons BUT with a twist:
     ⚠️  Polygon drawing is special! Click once = new point, click again = next point
     ⚠️  User must release mouse button after EACH point they add
  └─ 💡 POLYMORPHISM TIP:
     Let the TPolygon class override the startShape(), moveShape(), and endShape() 
     methods to handle this special multi-click behavior differently than other shapes!

📋 HTML INTEGRATION
  └─ Each shape needs an HTML element: "<div id="divPaintObject" class="paintObject">Shape-1</div>"
  └─ These go in: <div id="paintObjectList"></div>
  └─ Benefits:
     1. See all shapes in a list (even hidden ones!)
     2. Click to select shapes
     3. Reorder shapes by moving divs
     4. Delete button next to each shape
  └─ Link HTML selection to canvas selection (highlight the shape)

💡 DESIGN DECISION
  └─ Where should the HTML controls live?
     • In TShape class?
     • In each shape subclass?
     • In the ShapeContainer class?
     • In a separate ShapeUI class?
  └─ Think about what "owns" the HTML element!

/**
 * 🎨 DRAWING SETTINGS OBJECT
 * This tracks what the user has currently selected in the toolbar
 * 
 * 📌 DEFAULT VALUES (what buttons start as "active"):
 *    • ShapeType: Line (vs Circle, Rectangle, Pen, Oval, Polygon)
 *    • FillColor: Black
 *    • StrokeColor: Black
 *    • StrokeSize: Thin
 * 
 * 💡 TIP FOR CUSTOMIZATION:
 *    Want different buttons to be active when the app starts?
 *    Just change these default values!
 *    Example: Change StrokeColor to EColorType.Red to highlight the Red color button
 * 
 * ✏️ During gameplay:
 *    When user clicks a menu button (e.g., "Circle"), this object gets updated
 *    So when drawing a new shape, the app knows which settings to use

/**
 * 🎮 CREATE THE MENU TOOLBAR
 * Pass newShapeType so the menu knows which buttons should start as "highlighted"
 * (This happens in TMenu constructor → TButtonContainer.setDefaultButton())
 * You should look into the TSpriteButtonHaptic class
 * here can you se the sprite index switch for ide, hower, mouse down, mouse up, and if the button is desabled.
 * E.g. index {0, 1, 2, 3} for normal, hover, mouse down, disabled states.
